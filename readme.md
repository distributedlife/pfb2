# PushFlashBang 2

- PushFlashBang was a good idea that tried to do too much and fell over at some linguistic challenges
- V2 is bringing back the core ideas in a simpler model
- The goal, to quickly learn vocabulary with passable pronunciation whilst traveling
- This version doesn't do content addition. This is all handled by deployed yaml files
- There is no user model. If you want a copy, install your own
- There is no timing data. I originally captured timing data in order to better track the user's learning
- There is no history. That's a nice to have and you're welcome to add it.
- The focus is on reading, translating and some speaking. Listening, writing and typing are out of this version
- There is no cross language madness. I am no longer supporting Spanish via Russian. It all comes back to some other language, usually English.
- Sentences are in; they were not in the original but I think they will be important.
- Pronunciation guidance is in. It was one of the best parts
- The spaced repetition is back WITH the dynamic algorithm that tailors to how good you are.


# Immediate Plans

- Add translation in: See the English, remember the language and how to say it.
- Add sentences in. A sentence is included if you know all the words in the sentence. If there is a sentence to add, it is added. If there are none, we add a new word
- Number of reviews pending on the review page
